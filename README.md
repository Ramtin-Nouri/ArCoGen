# ArCoGen (Action Recognition for Compositional Generalization) Dataset, a fork of CATER

You can find the main repo under: [[Github](https://github.com/Ramtin-Nouri/Unsupervised-Learning-for-Generalization)]

## Dataset
This dataset is a variation of the CATER dataset. We use different parameters for the generation of the dataset and feature some changes in the codebase. The changes are as follows:
- use 10 FPS
- use only 1 and exactly one simoultaneous action
- guarantee the action is inside a 30 frame window
